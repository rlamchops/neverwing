Goal: Remove everwing messages from messenger
To use: Load extension into chrome, then press the neverwing button whenever everwing
  notifications need to be removed
Notes: These only sweep notifications once; the plugin does not persistently sweep them.
  The plugin must be executed again if more notifications appear.

Ideas: Try to make plugin persistent?
